*Forgive me father for I have synthed,*  
*Through circuits deep and waveforms wide,*  
*I've conjured sounds that never lived,*  
*From oscillators electrified.*

*With filters, envelopes, and LFOs,*  
*I've bent the frequencies so wild,*  
*Created tones that nobody knows,*  
*Each patch a sonic, bastard child.*

*No strings were plucked, no drums were struck,*  
*No breath through reed or brass did pass,*  
*Just voltage-controlled, synthetic luck,*  
*Pure waveforms rising from the grass.*

*So bless these bleeps and bloops I've made,*  
*These digital and analog dreams,*  
*For in this synthesized crusade,*  
*Nothing is quite what it seems.*
